#
# This defines the 'Bird' class, a simulated body that moves in a
# world according to its behavior, determined by its own motivations
# and the presence of other birds it reacts to.
#
# Below are the modifications we suggest for each of the exercises.
#

# EXERCISE 1
#
# . add a 'leave_trail' attribute that is either True/False
# . add a 'def setTrail(b)' method where 'b' is either True/False, for
#     turning on/off a bird's trail-leaving feature
# . modify 'step' to create a Trail object at a bird's position, but
#     only when it should be leaving a trail

# EXERCISE 2
#
# . modify 'step' to create three Trail objects at a bird's position, but
#     only when it should be leaving a trail

# EXERCISE 5
#
# . create a FLEE_COEFF (and perhaps a FLEE_RADIUS)
# . make computeFlee method that computes the acceleration component
#     when there's a predator nearby (according to FLEE_RADIUS)
# . change steer method to computeFlee using FLEE_COEFF
# . set the 'worried' attribute to True when it sees a predator, 
#     otherwise have that attribute be False  
#

# class Bird
#
# Implements one of the flocking agents, one of Reynolds' "boids".
# A bird has a velocity and a position.  These get updated over
# time using first-order Euler integration.  This is handled in
# the method 'step', which relies on the Point2D and Vector2D
# methods to modify a bird's position according to its velocity.
